            <p>
                Our program will implement a simple guessing game in which the computer generates one random card of the 9 cards<br />
                and the human player gets 5 chances to guess the secret card.<br />
                On each guess the program will tell the user whether or not their guess is correct or not.<br />
                As soon as the player guesses the card correctly or uses up their 5 guesses, the program will no longer accept guesses.
            </p>
            <h2>Are you ready to play?</h2>
