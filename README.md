# Guessing Game

This is our secomd assignment in WEB development:<br />

We implemented a simple guessing game in which the computer generates one random card of the 9 cards and the human player gets x chances to guess the secret card.<br />
On each guess the program will tell the user whether or not their guess is correct or not.<br />
As soon as the player guesses the card correctly or uses up their 5 guesses, the program will no longer accept guesses.<br />

Through the assignment we experienced html elements and js functionality we learned in class, and we also used different types of css. <br />
This assigment was coded as WEB assignment on the 1nd semester of our 3st year Information Systems at College of Law & Business.<br />
